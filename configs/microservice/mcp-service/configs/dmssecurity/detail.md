* * *

Core Features
-------------

**Secure Access**

*   **Account and Password Security Management**：Safely manage database account passwords without manual maintenance, effectively preventing sensitive information leakage.
*   **Fine-grained Permission Control**：Supports instance, database, table, field, and row-level access control, precisely restricting caller permissions to prevent unauthorized operations and ensure data security.
*   **High-risk SQL Identification and Blocking**: Built-in rich rule engine that identifies and blocks potential high-risk SQL in real time to mitigate security risks.
*   **SQL Audit Trail**: Records all SQL operation logs, supporting full traceability and compliance audits to meet regulatory requirements.

**Intelligent Data Inquiry**

*   **Built-in NL2SQL Algorithm**: Based on natural language input questions, it intelligently matches data tables, understands business semantics within tables, generates and executes SQL queries, and quickly obtains results.
*   **Personalized Knowledge Base**: Built-in metadata and [knowledge base](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/dms/knowledge-base-management?) for data inquiry, supports custom business knowledge and query patterns to build tailored intelligent data inquiry capabilities aligned with business scenarios.

Usage Methods
-------------

DMS MCP Server currently supports two usage modes.

### Mode One: Multi-instance Mode

*   Supports adding instances to DMS, allowing access to multiple database instances.
*   Suitable for scenarios where managing and accessing multiple database instances is required.

#### Scenario Example:

You are a company DBA who needs to manage and access various types of database instances (e.g., MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL) in production, test, and development environments. With DMS MCP Server, you can achieve unified access and centralized management of these heterogeneous databases.

**Typical Question Examples:**

*   Which of my instances are in the production environment?
*   Get a list of all databases named `test`.
*   Retrieve details of the `test_db` database from the `myHost:myPort` instance.
*   What tables are in the `test_db` database?
*   Use a tool to query data from the `test_db` database and answer: "What is today's user traffic?"

### Mode Two: Single Database Mode

*   Directly specify the target database by configuring the `CONNECTION_STRING` parameter in the server (format: `dbName@host:port`).
*   Suitable for scenarios that focus on accessing a single database.

#### Scenario Example 1:

You are a developer who frequently accesses a fixed database (e.g., `mydb@192.168.1.100:3306`) for development and testing. Set the `CONNECTION_STRING` parameter in the DMS MCP Server configuration as follows:

```
CONNECTION_STRING = mydb@192.168.1.100:3306
```

Afterward, every time the service starts, the DMS MCP Server will directly access this specified database without needing to switch instances.

**Typical Question Examples:**

*   What tables do I have?
*   Show the field structure of the `test_table` table.
*   Retrieve the first 20 rows from the `test_table` table.
*   Use a tool to answer: "What is today's user traffic?"

#### Scenario Example 2:

You are a data analyst at an e-commerce company, needing to frequently query and analyze business data such as orders, users, and products. The company's core business database is located at ecommerce@10.20.30.40:3306.

Configure the following parameters in DMS MCP Server:

```
CONNECTION_STRING = ecommerce@10.20.30.40:3306
```

Simply ask questions in natural language, and DMS MCP will parse the question into SQL and return the results.

**Typical Question Examples:**

*   What is the total number of orders today?
*   How are the order counts ranked by province?
*   What is the number of new users each day over the past 7 days?
*   Which product category has the highest sales revenue?

Prerequisites
-------------

*   [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) is installed
*   Python 3.10+ is installed
*   An [AK/SK](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/doc-detail/116811.html) or [STS Token](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/ram/product-overview/what-is-sts) with access rights to Alibaba Cloud DMS(AliyunDMSFullAccess).Add permission operations, see [Authorization Management](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/ram/user-guide/authorization-management/).

* * *

Pre-configuration
-----------------

Before accessing a database instance via DMS, you must first add the instance to DMS.

There are two methods to add an instance:

**Method One: Use the `addInstance` tool provided by DMS MCP to add an instance**

 The DMS MCP Server provides the `addInstance` tool for quickly adding an instance to DMS.

 For more details, see the description of the `addInstance` tool in the "Tool List."

**Method Two: Add an instance via the DMS console**

1.   Log in to the [DMS Console](https://dms.aliyun.com/).
2.   On the home page of the console, click the **Add Instance** icon in the database instance area on the left.
3.   On the Add Instance page, enter the instance information (e.g., instance address, port, username, password).
4.   Click **Submit** to complete the instance addition.
