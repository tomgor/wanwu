The server requires `wget` to be installed on your system.

### Installing wget

Using Homebrew:
```bash
brew install wget
```

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install wget
```

#### Linux (Red Hat/Fedora)
```bash
sudo dnf install wget
```

#### Windows

```bash
choco install wget
```

2. Or download the binary from: https://eternallybored.org/misc/wget/
   - Download the latest wget.exe
   - Place it in a directory that's in your PATH (e.g., C:\Windows\System32)

## Usage

The server provides a tool called `download_website` with the following parameters:

- `url` (required): The URL of the website to download
- `outputPath` (optional): The directory where the website should be downloaded. Defaults to the current directory.
- `depth` (optional): Maximum depth level for recursive downloading. Defaults to infinite. Set to 0 for just the specified page, 1 for direct links, etc.

### Example

```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com",

  "depth": 2  // Optional: Download up to 2 levels deep
}
```
