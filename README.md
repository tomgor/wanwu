    ```
    # amd64 / arm64
    WANWU_ARCH=amd64
    
    # external ip port (Note: localhost should be replaced with the local area network or external IP of the machine, such as 192.168.0.xx, and cannot be localhost or 127.0.0.1)
    WANWU_EXTERNAL_IP=localhost
    ```
    1.3 Create a Docker running network

### &#128172; Q & A
- **[Q] Error when starting Elastic (elastic-wanwu) on Linux system: Memory limited without swap.**
  **[A]** Stop the service, run `sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144`, and then restart the service.
  
- **[Q] After the system services start normally, the mysql-wanwu-worker and elastic-wanwu-setup containers exit with status code Exited (0).**
  **[A]** This is normal. These two containers are used to complete some initialization tasks and will automatically exit after execution.
  
- **[Q] Regarding model import**
  **[A]** Taking the import of Unicom Yuanjing LLM as an example (the process is similar for importing OpenAI-API-compatible models, Embedding, or Rerank types):
  ```
  1. The Open API interface for Unicom Yuanjing MaaS Cloud LLM is, for example: https://maas.ai-yuanjing.com/openapi/compatible-mode/v1/chat/completions
  2. The API Key applied for by the user on Unicom Yuanjing MaaS Cloud looks like: sk-abc********************xyz
  3. Confirm that the API and Key can correctly request the LLM. Taking a request to yuanjing-70b-chat as an example:
      curl --location 'https://maas.ai-yuanjing.com/openapi/compatible-mode/v1/chat/completions' \
      --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      --header 'Accept: application/json' \
      --header 'Authorization: Bearer sk-abc********************xyz' \
      --data '{
              "model": "yuanjing-70b-chat",
              "messages": [{
                      "role": "user",
                      "content": "你好"
              }]
      }'
  4. Import the model:
  4.1 [Model Name] must be the model that can be correctly requested in the curl command above; for example, yuanjing-70b-chat.
  4.2 [API Key] must be the key that can be correctly requested in the curl command above; for example, sk-abc********************xyz (note: do not include the 'Bearer' prefix).
  4.3 [Inference URL] must be the URL that can be correctly requested in the curl command above; for example, https://maas.ai-yuanjing.com/openapi/compatible-mode/v1 (note: do not include the /chat/completions suffix).
  5. Importing an Embedding model is the same as importing an LLM as described above. Note that the inference URL should not include the /embeddings suffix.
  6. Importing a Rerank model is the same as importing an LLM as described above. Note that the inference URL should not include the /rerank suffix.
  ```
