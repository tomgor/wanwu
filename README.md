### 🚀 Quick Start

- The workflow module of the Wanwu AI Agent Platform uses the following project, you can go to its warehouse to view the details.
  - v0.1.8 and earlier: wanwu-agentscope project
  - v0.2.0 and later: [wanwu-workflow](https://github.com/UnicomAI/wanwu-workflow/tree/dev/wanwu-backend) project

- **Docker Installation (Recommended**)

1. Before the first run

    1.1 Copy the environment variable file
    ```bash
    cp .env.bak .env
    ```

    1.2 Modify the `WANWU_ARCH` and `WANWU_EXTERNAL_IP` variables in the .env file according to the system
    ```
    # amd64 / arm64
    WANWU_ARCH=amd64
    
    # external ip port (Note: if the browser accesses Wanwu deployed on a non-localhost server, you need to change localhost to the external IP, for example, 192.168.xx.xx)
    WANWU_EXTERNAL_IP=localhost
    ```

    1.3 Configure the `WANWU_BFF_JWT_SIGNING_KEY` variable in the .env file, a custom complex random string used for generating JWT tokens
    ```
    # bff
    WANWU_BFF_JWT_SIGNING_KEY=
    ```

    1.4 Create a Docker running network
    ```
    docker network create wanwu-net
    ```

2. Start the service (the image will be automatically pulled from Docker Hub during the first run)

    ```bash
    # For amd64 system:
    docker compose --env-file .env --env-file .env.image.amd64 up -d
    # For arm64 system:
    docker compose --env-file .env --env-file .env.image.arm64 up -d
    ```

3. Log in to the system: http://localhost:8081

    ```
    Default user: admin
    Default password: Wanwu123456
    ```

4. Stop the service

    ```bash
    # For amd64 system:
    docker compose --env-file .env --env-file .env.image.amd64 down
    # For arm64 system:
    docker compose --env-file .env --env-file .env.image.arm64 down
    ```

- **Source Code Start (Development**)

1. Based on the above Docker installation steps, start the system service completely

2. Take the backend bff-service service as an example

    2.1 Stop bff-service
    ```
    make -f Makefile.develop stop-bff
    ```

    2.2 Compile the bff-service executable file
    ```
    # For amd64 system:
    make build-bff-amd64
    # For arm64 system:
    make build-bff-arm64
    ```

    2.3 Start bff-service
    ```
    make -f Makefile.develop run-bff
    ```

------

### ⬆️ Version Upgrade

1. Based on the above Docker installation steps, completely stop the system service

2. Update to the latest version of the code

    2.1 In the wanwu repository directory, update the code
    ```bash
    # Switch to the main branch
    git checkout main
    # Pull the latest code
    git pull
    ```

    2.2 Recopy the environment variable file (if there are changes to the environment variables, please modify them again)
    ```bash
    # Backup the current .env file
    cp .env .env.old
    # Copy the .env file

### &#128172; Q & A

- **[Q] Error when starting Elastic (elastic-wanwu) on Linux system: Memory limited without swap.**
  
  **[A]** Stop the service, run `sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144`, and then restart the service.
  
- **[Q] After the system services start normally, the mysql-wanwu-setup and elastic-wanwu-setup containers exit with status code Exited (0).**
  
  **[A]** This is normal. These two containers are used to complete some initialization tasks and will automatically exit after execution.
  
- **[Q] Regarding model import**
  
  **[A]** Taking the import of Unicom Yuanjing LLM as an example (the process is similar for importing OpenAI-API-compatible models, Embedding, or Rerank types):
  
  ```
  1. The Open API interface for Unicom Yuanjing MaaS Cloud LLM is, for example: https://maas.ai-yuanjing.com/openapi/compatible-mode/v1/chat/completions
  2. The API Key applied for by the user on Unicom Yuanjing MaaS Cloud looks like: sk-abc********************xyz
  3. Confirm that the API and Key can correctly request the LLM. Taking a request to yuanjing-70b-chat as an example:
      curl --location 'https://maas.ai-yuanjing.com/openapi/compatible-mode/v1/chat/completions' \
      --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      --header 'Accept: application/json' \
      --header 'Authorization: Bearer sk-abc********************xyz' \
      --data '{
              "model": "yuanjing-70b-chat",
              "messages": [{
                      "role": "user",
                      "content": "你好"
              }]
      }'
  4. Import the model:
  4.1 [Model Name] must be the model that can be correctly requested in the curl command above; for example, yuanjing-70b-chat.
  4.2 [API Key] must be the key that can be correctly requested in the curl command above; for example, sk-abc********************xyz (note: do not include the 'Bearer' prefix).
  4.3 [Inference URL] must be the URL that can be correctly requested in the curl command above; for example, https://maas.ai-yuanjing.com/openapi/compatible-mode/v1 (note: do not include the /chat/completions suffix).
  5. Importing an Embedding model is the same as importing an LLM as described above. Note that the inference URL should not include the /embeddings suffix.
  6. Importing a Rerank model is the same as importing an LLM as described above. Note that the inference URL should not include the /rerank suffix.
  ```
